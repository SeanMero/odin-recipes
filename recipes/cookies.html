        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 bananas</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups of rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F.</li>
            <li>Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Mash bananas in a bowl</li>
            <li>Add oats and mix</li>
            <li>Add chocolate chips and mix</li>
            <li>Spoon cookie mixture onto parchment paper in whatever sizes you like.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven. You <em>should</em> allow them to cool for a few minutes, but we both know you are going to try to eat one right away so we'd may as well add that to the instructions.</li>
